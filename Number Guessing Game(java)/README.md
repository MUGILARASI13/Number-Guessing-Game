# Reverse Number Guessing Game (Java)

This is a simple Java console project where the computer *guesses the number you thought of* using a math trick.

## 🎯 How It Works
1. You think of a number (but don’t type it).
2. The program asks you to:
   - Multiply it by 2  
   - Add 10  
3. Based on your final input, it calculates the original number using:
```
Original Number = (Final Result - 10) / 2
```
